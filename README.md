# 🎮 Java Tic Tac Toe – Console Application

A very basic **Java console application** for the classic Tic Tac Toe game.  
Built purely with Java, this program runs in the terminal/command-line and is a great beginner-friendly project for practicing Java fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This is a **simple two-player game** implemented in a Java console environment (like your IDE's terminal or command prompt).

- No GUI, no frameworks – just core Java.  
- Logic is written from scratch using only basic Java concepts.  
- Ideal for beginners to learn 2D arrays, loops, conditions, and user input.

---

## 🎯 Game Rules

- Two players take alternate turns: Player `X` and Player `O`.  
- The board is a 3x3 grid represented using a 2D array.  
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
- If all 9 cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
