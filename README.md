## 🎯 Game Rules

- Two players take alternate turns: Player `X` and Player `O`.  
- The board is a 3x3 grid represented using a 2D array.  
- The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
- If all 9 cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
